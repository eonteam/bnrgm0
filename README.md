## Note

The folder usr_config contains the file bluenrg_conf.h that is used to configure some parameters in BlueNRG-M0 (for example the Minimum/Maximum Advertising Interval), however we are not exposing them, we are just providing the defaults (should we expose them?). Only the BLUENRG_PRINTF can be selected how to work using the macro BNRGM0_LL_DEBUG.
